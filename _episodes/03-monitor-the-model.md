# Import & explore the data

### Import dataset
Here we want to work with the *weather prediction dataset* which can be [downloaded from Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5071376).
It contains daily weather observations from 18 different European cities or places through the years 2000 to 2010. For all locations the data contains the variables ‘mean temperature’, ‘max temperature’, and ‘min temperature’. In addition, for multiple of the following variables are provided: 'cloud_cover', 'wind_speed', 'wind_gust', 'humidity', 'pressure', 'global_radiation', 'precipitation', 'sunshine', but not all of them are provided for all locations. A more extensive description of the dataset including the different physical units is given in accompanying metadata file.

# Define the problem: Predict tomorrow's sunshine hours

### Select a subset and split into data (X) and labels (y)
The full dataset comprises 10 years (3654 days) from which we here will only select the first 3 years.
We will then define what exactly we want to predict from this data. A very common task with weather data is to make a predicion about the weather somewhere in the future, say the next day. The present dataset is sorted by "DATE", so for each row `i` in the table we can pick a corresponding feature and location from row `i+1` that we later want to predict with our model.
Here we will pick a rather difficult-to-predict feature, sunshine hours, which we want to predict for the location: BASEL.

~~~
nr_rows = 365*3
# data
X_data = data.loc[:nr_rows].drop(columns=['DATE', 'MONTH'])

# labels (sunshine hours the next day)
y_data = data.loc[1:(nr_rows + 1)]["BASEL_sunshine"]
~~~
{:.language-python}


# Prepare the data for machine learning
In general, it is important to check if the data contains any weird values such as `9999` or `NaN` or `NoneType`, for instance using pandas `data.describe()` function. If so, such values must be removed or replaced such values. 
In the present case the data is luckily pre-prepared to some extent and shouldn't contain such values, so that this step could here be omitted.

### Split data and labels into training, validation, and test set
As with classical machine learning techniques, it is common in deep learning to split off a *test set* which remains untouched during model training and tuning. It is then later be used to evaluate the model performance. Here, we will also split off an additional *validation set*, the reason of which will hopefully become clearer later in this lesson.

## Build a dense neural network

### Regression and classification - how to set a training goal
- Explain how to define the output part of a neural network
- What is the loss function (and which one to chose for a regression or classification task)?


In episode 2 we trained a dense neural network on a *classification task*. For this one hot encoding was used together with a Categorical Crossentropy loss function.
This measured how close the distribution of the neural network outputs corresponds to the distribution of the three values in the one hot encoding.
Now we want to work on a *regression task*, thus not prediciting the right class for a datapoint but a certain value (could in principle also be several values). In our example we want to predict the sunshine hours in Basel (or any other place in the dataset) for tomorrow based on the weather data of all 18 locations today. 

The network should hence output a single float value which is why the last layer of our network will only consist of a single node.

When compiling the model we can define a few very important aspects. We will discuss them now in more detail.

### Loss function:
The loss is what the neural network will be optimized on during training, so chosing a suitable loss function is crucial for training neural networks.
In the given case we want to stimulate that the prodicted values are as close as possible to the true values. This is commonly done by using the *mean squared error* (mse) or the *mean absolute error* (mae), both of which should work OK in this case. Often, mse is prefered over mae because it "punishes" large prediction errors more severely.
In keras this is implemented in the `keras.losses.MeanSquaredError` class (see keras documentation: https://keras.io/api/losses/).

### Optimizer:
Somewhat coupled to the loss function is the *optimizer* that we want to use. 
The *optimizer* here refers to the algorithm with which the model learns to optimize on the set loss function. A basic example for such an optimizer would be *stochastic gradient descent*. For now, we can largely skip this step and simply pick one of the most common optimizers that works well for most tasks: the *Adam optimizer*. 

### Metrics:
In our first example (episode 2) we plotted the progression of the loss during training. 
That is indeed a good first indicator if things are working alright, i.e. if the loss is indeed decreasing as it should. 
However, when models become more complicated then also the loss functions often become less intuitive. 
That is why it is good practice to monitor the training process with additional, more intuitive metrics. 
They are not used to optimize the model, but are simply recorded during training. 
With Keras they can simply be added via `metrics=[...]` and can contain one or multiple metrics of interest. 
Here we could for instance chose to use `'mae'` the mean absolute error, or the the *root mean squared error* (RMSE) which unlike the *mse* has the same units as the predicted values.

~~~
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mse',
              metrics=[keras.metrics.RootMeanSquaredError()])
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Train a dense neural network
Now that we created and compiled our dense neural network, we can start training it.
One additional concept we need to introduce though, is the `batch_size`.
This defines how many samples from the training data will be used to estimate the error gradient before the model weights are updated.
Larger batches will produce better, more accurate gradient estimates but also less frequent updates of the weights.
Here we are going to use a batch size of 32 which is a common starting point.
~~~
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                    batch_size=32,
                    epochs=200,
                    verbose=2)
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can plot the training process using the history:
~~~
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
history_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(history.history)
sns.lineplot(data=history_df['root_mean_squared_error'])
plt.xlabel("epochs")
plt.ylabel("RMSE")
~~~
{: .language-python}
![Output of plotting sample](../fig/03_training_history_1_rmse.png)

This looks very promising! Our metric ("RMSE") is dropping nicely and while it maybe keeps fluctuating a bit it does end up at fairly low *RMSE* values.
But the *RMSE* is just the root *mean* squared error, so we might want to look a bit more in detail how well our just trained model does in predicting the sunshine hours.

## Evaluate our model
There is not a single way to evaluate how a model performs. But there is at least two very common approaches. For a *classification task* that is to compute a *confusion matrix* for the test set which shows how often particular classes were predicted correctly or incorrectly. For the present *regression task* however, it makes more sense to compare true and predicted values in simple scatter plot. Hint: use `plt.scatter()`.

First, we will do the actual prediction step. 
> ## Predict the labels for both training and test set and compare to the true values
> Even though we here use a different model architecture and a different task compared to episode 2, the prediction step is mostly identical.
> Use the model to predict the labels for the training set and the test set and then compare them in a scatter plot to the true labels. Hint: use `plt.scatter()`.

Overfitting also happens in classical machine learning, but there it is usually interpreted as the model having more parameters than the training data would justify (say, a decision tree with too many branches for the number of training instances). As a consequence one would reduce the number of parameters to avoid overfitting.
In deep learning the situation is slightly different. It can -same as for classical machine learning- also be a sign of having a *too big* model, meaning a model with too many parameters (layers and/or nodes). However, in deep learning higher number of model parameters are often still considered acceptable and models often perform best (in terms of prediction accuracy) when they are at the verge of overfitting. So, in a way, training deep learning models is always a bit like playing with fire...

## Set expectations: How difficult is the defined problem?
Before we dive deeper into handling overfitting and (trying to) improving the model performance, let's ask the question: How well must a model perform before we consider it a good model?

Now that we defined a problem (predict tomorrow's sunshine hours), it makes sense to develop an intuition for how difficult the posed problem is. Frequently, models will be evaluated against a so called **baseline**. A baseline can be the current standard in the field or if such a thing does not exist it could also be an intuitive first guess or toy model. The latter is exactly what we would use for our case.

Maybe the simplest sunshine hour prediction we can easily do is: Tomorrow we will have the same number of sunshine hours as today.
(sounds very naive, but for many observables such as temperature this is already a fairly good predictor)

## Watch your model training closely
As we saw when comparing the predictions for the training and the test set, deep learning models are prone to overfitting. Instead of iterating through countless cycles of model trainings and subsequent evaluations with a reserved test set, it is common practice to work with a second split off dataset to monitor the model during training. This is the *validation set* which can be regarded as a second test set. As with the test set the datapoints of the *validation set* are not used for the actual model training itself. Instead we evaluate the model with the *validation set* after every epoch during training, for instance to splot if we see signs of clear overfitting.

Let's give this a try!

We need to initiate a new model -- otherwise Keras will simply assume that we want to continue training the model we already trained above.
~~~
model = create_nn()
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mse',
              metrics=[keras.metrics.RootMeanSquaredError()])
~~~
{: .language-python}

But now we train it with the small addition of also passing it our validation set:
~~~
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                    batch_size=32,
                    epochs=200,
                    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
                    verbose=2)
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Counteract model overfitting
Overfitting is a very common issue and there are many strategies to handle it.
Most similar to classical machine learning might to **reduce the number of parameters**.

We saw that reducing the number of parameters can be a strategy to avoid overfitting.
In practice, however, this is usually not the (main) way to go when it comes to deep learning.
One reason is, that finding the sweet spot can be really hard and time consuming. And it has to be repeated every time the model is adapted, e.g. when more training data becomes available.

## Early stopping: stop when things are looking best
Arguable **the** most common technique to avoid (severe) overfitting in deep learning is called **early stopping**.
As the name suggests, this technique just means that you stop the model training if things do not seem to improve anymore.
More specifically, this usually means that the training is stopped if the validation loss does not (notably) improve anymore.
Early stopping is both intuitive and effective to use, so it has become a standard addition for model training.

To better study the effect, we can now savely go back to models with many (too many?) parameters:
~~~
model = create_nn(100, 50)
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mse',
              metrics=[keras.metrics.RootMeanSquaredError()])
~~~
{: .language-python}

To apply early stopping during training it is easiest to use keras `EarlyStopping` class.
This allows to define the condition of when to stop training. In our case we will say when the validation loss is lowest.
However, since we have seen quiet some fluctuation of the losses during training above we will also set `patience=10` which means that the model will stop training of the validation loss has not gone down for 10 epochs.
~~~
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

earlystopper = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=10,
    verbose=1
    )

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                    batch_size = 32,
                    epochs = 200,
                    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
                    callbacks=[earlystopper],
                    verbose = 2)
~~~
{: .language-python}

As before, we can plot the losses during training:
~~~
history_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(history.history)
sns.lineplot(data=history_df[['root_mean_squared_error', 'val_root_mean_squared_error']])
plt.xlabel("epochs")
plt.ylabel("RMSE")
~~~
{: .language-python}

This still seems to reveal the onset of overfitting, but the training stops before the discrepancy between training and validation loss can grow further.
Despite avoiding severe cases of overfitting, early stopping has the additional advantage that the number of training epochs will be regulated automatically.
Instead of comparing training runs for different number of epochs, early stopping allows to simply set the number of epochs to a desired maximum value.

What might be a bit unintuitive is that the training runs might now end very rapidly
This might spark the question: have we really reached an optimum yet?
And often the answer to this is "no", which is why early stopping frequently is combined with other approaches to hinder overfitting from happening.
Overfitting means that a model (seemingly) performs better on seen data compared to unseen data. One then often also says that it does not "generalize" well.
Techniques to avoid overfitting, or to improve model generalization, are termed **regularization techniques** and we will come back to this in **episode 4**.


## BatchNorm: the "standard scaler" for deep learning
A very common step in classical machine learning pipelines is to scale the features, for instance by using sckit-learn's `StandardScaler`.
This can in principle also be done for deep learning.
An alternative, more common approach, is to add **BatchNormalization** layers which will learn how to scale the input values.
Similar to dropout, batch normalization is available as a network layer in keras and can be added to the network in a similar way.
It does not require any additional parameter setting. 

~~~
from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization

> ## Excercise: Add a BatchNormalization layer as the first layer to your neural network.
> Look at the [documentation of the batch normalization layer](https://keras.io/api/layers/normalization_layers/batch_normalization/). Add this as a first layer to the model we defined above. Then, train the model and compare the performance to the model without batch normalization.

It seems that no matter what we add, the overall loss does not decrease much further (we at least avoided overfitting though!).
Let's again plot the results on the test set:
~~~
y_test_predicted = model.predict(X_test)

plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5), dpi=100)
plt.scatter(y_test_predicted, y_test, s=10, alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel("predicted sunshine hours")
plt.ylabel("true sunshine hours")
~~~

Well... certainly not perfect. But how good or bad is this? Maybe not good enough to plan your picnic for tomorrow.
But let's better compare it to the naive baseline we created in the beginning. What would you say, did we improve on that?


# Outlook
Correctly predicting tomorrow's sunshine hours is apparently not that simple. 
Our models get the general trends right, but still predictions vary quiet a bit and can even be far off.
